  ## Description

  Coder Cove is a blog where coders can post their thoughts about coding and web development, as well as read and comment on other users' posts. The website features a homepage consisting of users' posts, personal user dashboards where users can create, update, and delete their own posts, login and signup pages where users can sign in or create an account, and individual post comment pages where anyone can read users' comments and logged in users can add their own comments. Coder Cove utilizes Sequelize, Node.js, Express, a MySQL database, and handlebars for templating.
